Example of a Play2 application that uses multiple projects
==========================================================

There is one main project and 4 subprojects:
- model (just a normal scala project without play)
- common (includes a BaseController that is used by the other subprojects)
- admin
- web

The project shows that with subprojects, really less files
are compiled when you change something (e.g. in routes or controllers)
than without subprojects.

When using "sbt run" in the main project, there is no real drawback of using subprojects.
All changes are picked up immediately, even changes in sub projects.

The test in the admin subproject does not work yet.
In https://github.com/FortyTwoEng/multiproject, nearly the same
test works in subprojects, but the subprojects have their own
application.conf there, maybe that is the difference.

Other possible problems:
- in a subproject that is not a Play project, you have to set the scala version
  explicitly in the Build file
